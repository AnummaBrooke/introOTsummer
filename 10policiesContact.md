You are required to read your G-ETS e-mail every day to assure that you receive course information disseminated by e-mail in a timely fashion.

When composing email for the class or teaching staff, the salutation, signature, tone, and content must be appropriately professional.

"Turn-around" times:
 * Email: I typically read email twice each day, once in the morning and once in the evening. I will respond or take action on emails within 24 hours, usually sooner. * Voice mail: I will play messages as soon as possible, and respond or take action within 24 hours. * Texting: I will normally see a text message almost immediately, and respond (not take action) when possible. Please it short and non-actionable. * Meeting: Please reach me to plan meetings during published office hours. I can manage online meetings by G-ETS Gmail Video Chat, by Skype, or by Google+ Hangouts.
