## Assignments:

Besides the descriptions below, see also the assessment rubrics provided for each assignment.

Our weekly schedule is largely predictable. Each week will include 1) an individual assignment (from the Stanley book); 2) a Group assignment (exegesis of an assigned passage); 3) an open forum on the video lectures. In every weekly assignment, the student has obligations to her Group.

**Individual Assignment from Stanley:**

* Each week, a few Exercises from the Stanley book will be made available.
* By Thursday morning at 9:00 CT, choose and write one of the available Exercises. 
* By the following Monday morning at 9:00 CT, write a Reply to each member of your Group, according to the instructions provided for such replies. 
* Students taking a planned week away will need to accomplish this assignment ahead of time, and write their Replies on return.

**Group Activity in Exegesis:**

* Throughout the term, we will do weekly Group exercises in the exegesis of Daniel 8:9-14.
* For each activity, every student will be assigned a "role" in their Group (e.g., moderator, collector).
* At the end of the activity, each student will perform a self-assessment and peer assessment.
* Students taking a planned week away will need to swap roles and otherwise negotiate with their Group as necessary; this should be done well ahead of time.

**Open Integrative Forum on Video Lectures:**

* Each week, a forum will be posted relating to one or both of the video lectures for that week.
* By Wednesday morning 9:00 CT, every student will post to that forum, according to its instructions.
* By Friday morning 9:00 CT, each student will respond appropriately to at least three (3) classmates.
* Students taking a planned week away will need to accomplish this assignment ahead of time, and write their Replies on return.
