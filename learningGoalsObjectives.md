## Learning Goals and Objectives:

The Hebrew Bible is a *library*: diverse texts, written by many authors, with their competing claims, over the course of a millennium. The authors' *circumstances* varied enormously: from leadership to marginalization, from empire to occupation, from agriculture to urbanism, from exodus to exile. Its works are of several *literary genres*, each with its own functions and native institutions: chronicle, lament, myth, genealogy, riddle, dirge, cult legend, taunt song, didactic discourse, tribal boast tale, hymnody, and more. 

### Knowing: 

Students will grow more closely familiar with:

* the detailed content of our primary text, the Old Testament;
* the religious practices reflected in the texts of the Hebrew Bible as part of the phenomenon of religion and religious practice
* the history of critical approaches to biblical texts, especially approaches concerning the Bible's historical contexts and literary forms.

### Doing: 

Students will:

* demonstrate critical thinking about evidence;
* construct and assess reasoned arguments. An "argument" is not a "fight," but rather a series of statements that, if assented to, support a concluding statement.
* distinguish in practice between questions exegetical ("what the text _meant_ to its author") and hermeneutical ("what might the text _mean_ to later readers").

### Being: 

Our shared goal is to grow in our role as responsibly informed, fearless researchers and conversation partners in critical biblical studies.
