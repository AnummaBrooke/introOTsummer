## Learning Goals and Objectives:

The Hebrew Bible is a *library*: diverse texts, written by many authors, with their competing claims, over the course of a millennium. The authors' *circumstances* varied enormously: from leadership to marginalization, from empire to occupation, from agriculture to urbanism, from exodus to exile. Its works are of several *literary genres*, each with its own functions and native institutions: chronicle, lament, myth, genealogy, riddle, dirge, cult legend, taunt song, didactic discourse, tribal boast tale, hymnody, and more.

### Knowing: 

Students will grow more closely familiar with:

* the detailed content of our primary text, the Old Testament;
* the religious practices reflected in the texts of the Hebrew Bible as part of the phenomenon of religion and religious practice
* the history of critical approaches to biblical texts, especially approaches concerning the Bible's historical contexts and literary forms.

### Doing: 

Students will:

* demonstrate critical thinking about evidence;
* construct and assess reasoned arguments. An "argument" is not a "fight," but rather a series of statements that, if assented to, support a concluding statement. 
* distinguish between structured and unstructured questions. A structured questions has a single correct answer (known or unknown). For example, "When was the Exile? We know it was 586-539 B.C.E." An unstructured question is one for which more than one answer might be reasonably proposed (by use of evidence and an explicit line of reasoning). For example, "By what chain of events did Israel come to occupy the highlands of Canaan? There are several related proposals for this." Students agree that solutions to unstructured questions are not simply matters of unassailable personal preference, but are vulnerable to the crucible of reasoned critique.

### Being: 

Our shared goal is to grow in our role as responsibly informed, fearless researchers and conversation partners in biblical studies.
