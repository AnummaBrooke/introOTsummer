### Attendance, Missing Work, and Time Management: 

#### Attendance:

All work must be completed on time as assigned, including non-graded assignments. Late work will not be accepted. Missing work will score a "zero," of course, and also counts as "absences." All such "absences" count against one's Participation grade. When such "absences" approach 20% of the material (slightly more than a week), the student should expect to fail the course.

For this summer course, a student may opt to choose one (1) seven-day period in which she will be absent from activities. **This still counts as "absence" in terms of attendance.** So, the student should guard carefully against further absence. (In other words, such a week pretty much "uses up" one's allowable absenteeism.) But, by arranging to accomplish the work, the student still gets full credit for the assignments. Students electing to take a seven-day vacation must: 

* choose a week that is NOT the first week of the term;
* alert the teaching staff DURING that first week of the term about her chosen week to be absent;
* plan to submit any written work due that week *before* the absence (see assignment descriptions);
* communicate as necessary with any Group members before and after absence.


#### Time-management requirements:

The course is doubly challenging regarding time management: intensive, and online.

1. Students should plan to spend *at least eighteen (18) focused hours each week* on this three-credit summer intensive course. For example, most students will require about 6-7 hours per week to read the textbook and relevant biblical passages, about 2-3 hours for video lectures, and about 8-10 hours per week to accomplish weekly activities. For many reasons, some students may find that more hours are required; perhaps many more. Students should plan to accomplish these hours by means of several reasonably short "sittings," not one or two huge chunks. I recommend three hours per day, six days per week. Remember that this is an *intensive* summer session.
2. Obviously, students who opt to "pre-read" the Stanley textbook can considerably lighten their weekly work load during our weeks in session.
3. The course will involve several deadlines staggered throughout the week. For example, a student may be required to post in a Discussion Forum on Tuesdays, and to post Replies to others on Fridays. This course is *not* self-paced, and deadlines will *not* all fall on a single day of the week.
4. Students should plan to be self-starters, reading the syllabus and any rubrics with care, getting to know the Moodle course management system, keeping a calendar, and striving to "stay ahead" of weekly expectations. Professors will seek to communicate expectations, but will not normally offer "reminders" about expectations already articulated in the syllabus and rubrics.
