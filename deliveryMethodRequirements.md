##Delivery Method and Requirements:

Technical requirements:

1. Students must have regular, reliable access to a broad-band (high-speed) internet connection (e.g., DSL or cable; experience shows that modem dial-up will not prove sufficient). Courses will have frequent, perhaps even daily, deadlines that must be accomplished with online activity.

2. Students must have access to a reasonably up-to-date computer and operating system, sufficient to run an up-to-date web browser. Computers must play sound. The G-ETS library has a limited number of laptop computers available for check-out. The Northwestern University Library has a computer center as well.

3. Students must plan to use a recent version of a major Web browser (e.g., Firefox 3 or later; Safari 3; Google Chrome 4 or later; Opera 9 or later; MS Internet Explorer 7 or later). Note especially that MS Internet Explorer 6, still common on older machines, is NOT supported.

4. Students must be able to work with files normal to the Microsoft Office environment, especially *.doc/*.docx, *.ppt/*.pptx. Many students with Apple computers can manage such files with the iWork suite of applications. Students without MS Office or Apple iWork might try the freely available OpenOffice application: http://www.openoffice.org/

5. This course uses pre-recorded lectures in *.m4v format. Mac users can play them on QuickTime or iTunes. Many Windows users find that they play fine on Windows player, but you may prefer to download Apple QuickTime for Windows ([http://support.apple.com/kb/DL837][rlqt]) or iTunes for Windows ([http://www.apple.com/itunes/download][rlit]/).
